Based on the information provided, here are five demographics you might want to target:

Pre-med students: These students often need to take general chemistry as a prerequisite for medical school. On top of that, they're likely to have other difficult science courses in their curriculum, so they could benefit from your video content.

Nursing students: You've already mentioned this demographic, but it's worth reemphasizing. These students often have to memorize a lot of information in a short amount of time, so your visual learning method could be very helpful for them.

Pharmacy students: Like pre-med and nursing students, these students also take a lot of science courses that require memorization. They might find your videos useful for their studies.

High school students preparing for AP exams: If your content is applicable to high school level chemistry, you might want to target high school students who are studying for AP Chemistry exams.

Adult learners/Continuing education students: Many adults return to school to further their education or change careers. They might be interested in your content, especially if they're going into a field that requires a lot of memorization, like nursing or pharmacy.

As for an aggressive cost plan, you might consider these strategies:

Social Media Advertising: Use targeted ads on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter to reach your desired demographics.

Google Ads: This can be a great way to reach people who are actively searching for help with their chemistry or nursing courses.

Affiliate Marketing: Consider partnering with bloggers or influencers who have a large following of students. They can promote your platform and get a commission for each person who signs up.

Email Marketing: Collect emails on your website and send regular updates about new videos, flashcards, and other resources.

Free Trial Promotion: Promote your free trial aggressively. This will get people on your platform and give them a chance to see the value of your content.

Remember to always track your marketing efforts to see what's working and what's not. This will help you allocate your budget more effectively.
